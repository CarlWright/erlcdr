erlcdr
======

An erlang application that reads a GSM Call Detail Record file and turns it into an ASCII file.

This applicationa dn its use of bit syntax converted me to Erlang. I'd looked at fourteen  years
eariler, but was then uninterested. Ah, the wonders that might have been if I'd converted much sooner.
